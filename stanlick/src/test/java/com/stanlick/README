Notes

Logic to compute "workingDaysOpen" is computed in realtime as ElapsedUtil is accessing current LocalDate to
calculate work days since ticket was received

1) Ticket object has only a "received on" date.  When a ticket is closed, the number of work days it was open is
stored in that ticket object.

2) Ticket contains a close() method that determines total weekdays open and populates Ticket attribute (for SQL UPDATE)

3) Number of weekdays an open ticket has remained open is determined by asking the ticket object getWorkingDaysOpen()

4) Asking a closed ticket object for its number of "workingDaysOpen" will simply return the prior computed number
of days without any further processing.
